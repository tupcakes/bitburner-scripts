# bitburner-scripts

## Notes
Some scripts are from other repos. I've either modified them for my own purposes or juse used them as is. I'll add source repo commments to the files over time.

## Git pull
```
nano git-pull.js
```
Copy contents of file into new file and run.

## What to run
I've changed and tweaked this process frequently, so this is subject to change.

### Starting out
Run bootstrap.js.

Eventually, it will bootstrap up a home server with 256 gb ram. That should be enough to run the basic scripts.

Crime.js will get karma to where a gang will get going.

...

Profit.
